                                Every death of a child is a great tragedy. In many countries, 
                                too many children die from preventable or treatable causes. 
                                The map above shows the average child mortality rate for each country from 1950 to 2017. 
                                We can find in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, 
                                where the child mortality rate is more than ten percent, which means that for every ten children born, 
                                one will not reach the age of five. It is not difficult to find that the child mortality rate in developed countries, 
                                including the United States and the United Kingdom, is far lower than that in these areas. 
                                In this article we will look at the leading causes of child mortality in the world view, 
                                the relationship in health expenditure and child mortality rate, 
                                using Denmark and Turkey as an example and how would the Turkey mortality rate look like in the 2025. 
                                Whether it will achieve the  UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Reduce the child mortality rate to at least as low as 2.5% in all countries by 2030.

                                The bar chart above lists the top 5 causes for child deaths from 1990-2015. They are Lower respiratory infection, Neonatal preterm birth complications, Diarrheal diseases, birth asphyxia and trauma, malaria. As we look at it, child mortality has been declining in recent years, but these five factors are still dominant. Most of these causes of death can be improved and prevented through universal access to quality prenatal care, skilled delivery care, maternal and infant postnatal care, and care for small and sick newborns. Malnutrition is also a potential contributing factor, which may increase the incidence of child disease. That is why child mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are so much higher than in developed countries (WHO, 2020).

                                This chart shows the relationship between child mortality and health expenditure in Turkey and Denmark from 1970 to 2015.As can be seen from this table, the child mortality rate in Turkey was initially 120% of that in Denmark. However, due to the continuous investment in medical care in Turkey, the child mortality rate in Turkey has been sharply reduced. In just 45 years, child mortality has fallen by nearly 140 percent. Denmark, by contrast, spends three times as much on health care as Turkey, but much more slowly. Thus it can be seen that under the premise of a large base of child mortality, a high return can be achieved with only a small investment in medical services. However, the child mortality rate in Denmark is approaching saturation, and it is difficult to make a significant improvement if the medical investment is further increased.

                            <p>From the above analysis, it can be seen that with the decrease of child mortality, the impact of financial input on health services may gradually decrease. In order to verify this view, we forecast the child mortality in Turkey in 2025. As we can see from the graph, the curve of child mortality tends to flatten out and is likely to remain within a fixed range for some time. Overall, although increasing the amount of money spent on health care could save more children's lives, the effect was most obvious when the base was large, and if the base was small, then blindly investing money might enter a bottleneck. In this case, people would have to look for other ways to intervene.
